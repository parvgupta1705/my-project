JavaScript Explanation (Live Character Counter Project)

1. DOM Selection

document.getElementById("textInput")
Finds the <textarea> element using its id="textInput".

document.getElementById("charCount")
Finds the <span> element where the character count will be shown.

This step connects JavaScript to the HTML elements we want to work with.

2. Event Listener

textInput.addEventListener("input", function() { ... })
Listens for the "input" event, which occurs whenever the user types, deletes, or pastes something inside the <textarea>.

This ensures that the character count updates live while typing.

3. Updating Character Count

textInput.value.length
.value gives the current text typed inside the <textarea>.
.length counts how many characters are present in that text.

charCount.textContent = textInput.value.length;
Changes the content of <span id="charCount"> to display the updated character count.

This is how the number of characters is shown dynamically to the user.
